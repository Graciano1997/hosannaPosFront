# Hosanna Sale Point – Front

**Hosanna Sale Point** is a modern, efficient Sales Point (POS) system designed to manage product sales, transactions, and inventory with ease. This repository contains the **Front-End**, built with **React** and powered by **ReduxJs** for robust state management. The Backend, developed in **Ruby on Rails**, is maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Graciano1997/hosanaPosBackend.git).


## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **ReactJS** – A JavaScript library developed by Facebook, designed for building user interfaces with better modularity and component-based architecture.
- **ReduxJS** – A predictable state management library for JavaScript apps, often used with React to manage application-wide state in a centralized and consistent way.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern, responsive UIs directly in your HTML or JSX, without writing custom CSS.
